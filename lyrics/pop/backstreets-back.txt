***************My Experiment**************

Ayy, like here we go, here we go, here we go now
Me and you catchin' fights when it go down
Late nights in Dubai, it's a coupe (skrrt)
Been fallin' fast, can't lie, it's the truth (nah)
Like here we go, here we go, here we go now (here we go)
I swear I feel like I've been here before now
And I'd rather chill with you than with my bros (all my bros)
