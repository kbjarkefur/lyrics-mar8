And no more shall we part
It will no longer be necessary
And no more will I say, dear heart
I am alone and she has left me
And no more shall we part
The contracts are drawn up
The ring is locked upon the finger
And never again will my letters start
Sadly, or in the depth of winter
And no more shall we part
All the hatchets have been buried now
And all of the birds will sing to your
Beautiful heart
Upon the bough
And no more shall we part
Your chain of command
Has been silenced now
